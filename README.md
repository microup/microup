# Hi Everyone :wave:
I'm a software developer with more than 15 years of experience! I have written and developed code in various languages such as C++, Python, Delphi, and have had some experience with C# and Java. However, currently, I am a big fan of the Go programming language and strive to learn and utilize this fantastic development tool to the fullest. I enjoy learning new technologies and also creating useful programs and utilities.
